# Action Recognition in Tennis Using Deep Neural Networks

## Authors: Vincent Chow and Ohi Dibua 

This is the code repository for our CS230: Deep Learning final project. Our goal was to apply deep learning techniques to classify videos of players performing tennis strokes (e.g. forehand, backhand, service).

## LRCNN

The **lrcnn** folder contains code used in the Inception V3 CNN + LSTM approach.

## Optical Flow

The **optical_flow** folder contains code used in the optical flow + LSTM approach.
